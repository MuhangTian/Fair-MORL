# Fair Multi-objective Reinforcement Learning CS+ Summer Research
* Environments suitable for testing fair multi-objective reinforcement learning:
  * Bandit environment with a single state: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1NvALGY0kPwjz6ibj9H4S5taTDGVZWC3pKA1PXseI8r4/edit
  * Taxi MDP environment: https://docs.google.com/document/d/16Ot75_Pw65V51QLKaXE1-ifJhQtf4AEkqZ0E87XbKrk/edit
* Experiments run with above environmens, with different RL algorithms (Q-learning, modifed NSW Q-learning, Bandit Algorithm and NSW bandit algorithm)
  * Code implementation of above algorithms
  * Trained Q-tables of above algorithms
  * Visualization of results for comparison
