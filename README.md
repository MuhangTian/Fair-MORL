# Fair Multi-objective Reinforcement Learning Research
* Simulation environments suitable for running multi-objective reinforcement learning algorithms and test fairness criteria:
  - Bandit environment with a single state: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1NvALGY0kPwjz6ibj9H4S5taTDGVZWC3pKA1PXseI8r4/edit
  - Taxi MDP environment: https://docs.google.com/document/d/16Ot75_Pw65V51QLKaXE1-ifJhQtf4AEkqZ0E87XbKrk/edit
* Experiments run with above environmens, with different MORL algorithms
  * Code implementation of those algorithms
  * Trained Q-tables of above algorithms
  * Visualization of results
